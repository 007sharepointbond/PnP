#Patterns and Practices
This is the Community Source Code location for the SharePoint and Office App Model Samples. We will be revising and enhancing the samples here and they should be considered just that, samples. We are working with the MSDN Content Publishing team to take the most impactful and useful samples that complete common customer scenarios and publishing them as "Solution Packs" of content as well as "Sample Packs" of sample code that has been reviewed by the Office 365 team and blessed as a recommended way to approach these scenarios. 

This package is released by a group of volunteers who are committed to continue further expanding this sample package in the future. Notice that we use CodePlex project only as our publishing channel and the actual source code is stored in different location. Our downloadable release packages will however contain code and documentation for each of the released example.

Currently this project is very focused on the SharePoint scenarios but we are keeping a keen eye towards including the all-up Office Developer story as we move forward.

#FAQ

##I'm not familiar of the code, where can I get help or assistance?
Please use the CodePlex issue and discussion functionalities to get assistance. We will be also releasing videos and additional guidance based on your feedback, so let us know what's missing and we'll look to address it.

##I found bug from the package, how to proceed?
Please use the issues section in this CodePlex site. Don't be shy, sharing your findings is critical for the success of the CAM/App patterns. We would welcome not just a bug submission but if you have a proposed workaround, Please share that as well.

##I have suggestions or improvements to the provided package, how to proceed?
We would be extremely pleased with any feedback and suggestions on the package. Please report any suggestions to the package using the discussion boards. We will be closely following any messages to this group. 

##Can I use this code and material within any project I'm involved?
Feel free to utilize this anyway you want. You can use these in your demos, own projects, customer project or even write additional blog posts about them. We hope that our learning leads to more predictable and repeatable implementations. 

##What is the reference of these examples in MSDN guidance?
We try to keep Office AMS project as agile as possible to minimize any delays on sharing examples. MSDN will be updated based what we also do in AMS project, but that takes always some additional time to ensure that samples follow up on the official publishing guidance. So, If you aren't afraid to tear apart code with minimal assistance, feel free to do so. If you prefer to wait until more complete guidance comes along to accompany it, by all means wait for the more formal guidance in the MSDN Solution Packs.

##What if I want to contact the Office AMS team directly?

Please use the discussion functionality in this project site as the primary collaboration tool. Please note also that Office App Model Samples (AMS) initiative is a community program, so there's no support SLA for any of the examples. This is an effort by the community, for the community.
