Installation Steps:
1. This app Part reads information from a hardcoded list called Events and then renders a nice minicalendar to be used on webpart pages.
SO dont forget to create the List, or modify the code to read from a different list.
2.  For Development purposes you can press F5 for testing.
3.  To install in a production environment, Publish the App, submit to the App Catalog, and then you can install it on any site.

To be done for future releases:
1. Make the Events list name customizable via App Part Properties.
2. Make the colors rendered by CSS customizable via App Part Properties.
